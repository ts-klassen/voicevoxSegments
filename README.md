# voicevoxSegments

English | [日本語](./readme-ja.md)

I call the segments of pronunciation (=アクセント句) voicevoxSegments.

In Japanese, what are the most common voicevoxSegments?

Here I made, or still making, a program to workout that.

Only works when you have voicevox running in http://localhost:50021 .
